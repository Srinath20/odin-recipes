        <h4>Description</h4>
        Baby corn (also known as young corn, cornlets or baby sweetcorn) is a cereal grain taken from corn (maize) harvested early while the stalks are still small and immature. It typically is eaten whole — cob included — in contrast to mature corn, whose cob is too tough for human consumption.
