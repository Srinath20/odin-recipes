        <h4>Description</h4>
        Chilli paneer is an Indian Chinese appetizer traditionally made with paneer, bell peppers, onions, spring onions and a mix of spices and sauces. It can be served dry or with some gravy. When made with some gravy it is served with rice.The paneer is fried when made in the traditional manner. I briefly pan fry the chilli paneer for my recipe.
